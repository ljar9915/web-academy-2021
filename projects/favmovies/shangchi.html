     <th style="width:75%"><p style="color:white; font-size:18px">shang-chi & the legend of the ten rings is about Shang-chi, the son of Xu Wenwu who holds the ten rings. at a young age, shang-chi escapes his father's organization to go live his own life in the united states. his past catches up to him when his dad sends people out to bring him & his sister xialing back to the organization. wenwu says that he is going to the village of ta lo to rescue shang-chi's late mom who he believes is trapped there. shang-chi, his friend katy, & his sister xialing embark on a journey to find the Ta Lo village & stop wenwu from destroying it.</p>
     <p style="color:white; font-size:18px">shang-chi & the legend of the ten rings is one of my favorite movies because of the storyline & the epic battle scenes. from the beginning with wenwu & shang-chi's mom dancing in the ta lo garden to the end with the battle between the two dragons, the movie is beautifully directed. of course marvel never dissapoints with the cinematography, & shang-chi definitely was not an exception. the cinematography makes me the whole movie looks even more beautiful than it already is. i felt like i had to come back to earth from the movie realm when i walked out the theater.</p>
     <p style="color:white; font-size:18px">i chose red, orange & yellow for the color scheme to match the ten rings. most of the movie posters for shang-chi feature this color scheme as well.</p></th>
