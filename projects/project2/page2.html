        <p> in my life, creativity is not just a character trait or a hobby: it's a way of life. i value creativity by always looking for opportunities to express myself creatively. one of those opportunities is this class- i often use my websites to showcase my personal aesthetic & artistic vision. i also enjoy sketching, painting, sewing, & graphic design as other outlets for my creativity. </p>
